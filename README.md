# latex-snippets
LaTeX YASnippet collection (not only) following the 'Short Math Guide for LaTeX' by Michael Downes, and Barbara Beeton.

## Development setup
Run `./setup-dev.sh` as root on a machine with internet access. It installs
Emacs, the yasnippet package, and tempel for snippet expansion. The script also
tangles `snippets.org` into `org-mode/`.
